# The [TripleAJ Arcade](https://azeem-khan1.github.io/TripleAJv3/)

## About

The TripleAJ Arcade is a virtual arcade with inbuilt currency. Users can sign up for free and start off with 30 tokens. They will pay tokens to play several digital arcade games and will earn tokens upon victory/score. Userâ€™s will also be able to view a live leaderboard based on number of tokens. Features include a free sign-up, a login authentication system, and the ability to change your password, delete your account, keep track of your live token count, and view all registered players the leaderboard. Most of these features require creating, reading, updating, and/or deleting data, so we have our entire backend database built in Python and SQL on a Flask framework, which is deployed using AWS and Docker.
