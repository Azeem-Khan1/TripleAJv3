# DevOps
> I am responsible for the efficient operation and deployment of our website. This includes working with the development team to build and test code, and ensuring that the software is deployed and running efficiently in production. I am also responsible for monitoring the system and identifying areas for improvement,as well as updating the site so there are no errors. I will work closely with the dev team to troubleshoot issues and identify issues and bugs. Another one of my responsibilities is making sure the website is up at all times, updated and with no issues
 
## Obtaining a Custom Domain Using a DNS
> One of my responsibilities is to ensure that our group's website is accessible and running smoothly. To do this, I will work on obtaining a custom domain using a DNS. This involves selecting and purchasing a domain name that is relevant to our website, and then configuring the DNS settings to point the domain name to a server or IP address. I may also work with the dev team to make sure that the necessary DNS records are created and properly configured, and I will monitor the DNS to ensure that it is functioning properly and providing fast and reliable access to our websites and applications. By handling the DNS setup and maintenance, I am effectively keeping the site up and running.
 
## Avoiding Conflict
> In order to avoid push/pull conflicts, as DevOps, I will manage communication and make sure everyone is on the same page. I will also overview all the commits and pushes and pulls so that everything is organized and confusion is avoided.
