## Feature Ideas (Team)

### Azeem

> We will have four different arcade games for the user to spend tokens on. They will need to pay to play each game and can earn tokens from each game they win. There will be a leaderboard based on # of tokens that a user has.

### Ahad

> We will have an account system that will be stored in a database. This will require creating records with usernames, passwords, full names, and # of tokens.

### Josh

> We will structure the site with a submenu at the top. This will give the user options to customize their account, pay to play games, and see the leaderboard.


### Akshat

> We will incorporate CRUD in our database by creating records when a user signs up, reading records when displaying username and # of tokens on the account page, updating records by allowing the user to change their name and password if they need + having the user pay and earn tokens, and deleting records by giving the user the option to delete their account.
