# Our Idea

The TripleAJ Arcade is a virtual arcade with inbuilt currency. Users can sign up for free and start off with 20 tokens. They will pay tokens to play several digital arcade games and will earn tokens upon victory/score. User's will also be able to view a live leaderboard based on number of tokens. Account customization will include the ability to enter a user's full name -to display on the leaderboard- and change their password, which will update the corresponding record in our database, deployed on AWS with a flask framework.

# Applying our idea to the CPT Rubric

| Category | Expectation | Explanation |
| :------: | ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | Describes the purpose of the program, describes the program's functionality, and can take an input and return an output. | The purpose of this program is to provide the user with an entertaining and competitive experience through the gameplay of several virtual arcade games along with the exchange of digital currency. |
| Data Abstraction | Shows how data has been stored in a collection and shows data from that collection as it contributes to the overall purpose of the program. Identifies the name of a variable representing the collection being used and describes what the data contained in the collection represents in the program. | Our program abstracts data through the creation of records that are added to a backend database. The purpose of this database is to store crucial information about a user such as the number of tokens they have. This value can be used in our program to construct a leaderboard of players with the highest number of tokens in order to create a more competitive experience. |
| Managing Complexity | Shows a collection of data that manages complexity. Explains an alternative method that would have been more complex and explains why that method could not be used or how it would have to be written differently. |  |
| Procedural Abstraction | Shows a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure, and shows where that procedure is called. Describes how the procedure contributes to the functionality of the program. |  |
| Algorithm Implementation | Includes a student-developed algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. Explains how the algorithm works in detail enough to where someone could recreate it. |  |
| Testing | Describe two calls to the selected procedure in response 3c. Each call must pass a argument that causes different outputs. Describes conditions being tested by each call. Identifies the result of each call. |  |
